		 <h3>My Hobbies and Other Info</h3>
     <ul>
     <li>Video Games</li>
     <li>Coding</li>
     <li>Snowboarding</li>
     </ul>
     <p> For the last 6 years I've been a lease operator in the West Texas oil field. Here recently I've decided to pursue something I would want to do for the rest of my life. I've always loved video games but just the intro to coding has given me a whole new perspective on the games I've been playing for years.</p>
     <p> Thinkful is giving me the chance to pursue something I never thought possible in software development. I've always loved, not just playing games on the computer, but being on the computer in general. The idea of having a career where I could put my computer skills to work used to    sound like a dream. </p>
     <p> Along with video games, application development, and web design are things I'd like to explore more. </p>
